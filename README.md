My vim Config
=============

This is just a git repo of my vimrc and some plugins.  I've moved to vundle to 
handle all of my plugins, which is added as a submodule in this repo.

To clone be sure to use recursive to pull in vundle:

    git clone --recursive git@github.com:andrewrchambers/vimconf.git
